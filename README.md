**How does the application work**

In this assignment, we have a market store with three different types of discounts. In the package Card, we have one abstract class Card with abstract method discountRate. Also, we have three child classes, one for each card type. All of these classes have their own method for calculation of discount rate based on card type and previous month turnover. In another package, PayDesk we have static methods for output the discount Rate, discount, and total purchase value. Also, here is added a print method. In the main class, we create a few instances with a sample for every card type.
